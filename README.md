# Binary Classification: Depression Detection
This project is part of the Kaggle Playground Series Competition, focused on building a binary classification model to predict whether an individual is depressed based on provided data.

## Key Highlights
### 1.Data Cleaning:
->Utilized pandas and numpy for handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
->Applied feature engineering, including mapping values for the Sleep Duration feature.
### 2.Categorical Encoding:
->Employed LabelEncoder to encode categorical features effectively.
### 3.Model Training:
->Built and compared multiple models, including:Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Models: XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM (LGBM)
### 4.Results:
->Achieved a high accuracy of 92% using the CatBoost model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this dataset.
